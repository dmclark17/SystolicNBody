# SystemVerilog Systolic Array

The files `2x2-systolic-n-body.sv` and `2x2-systolic-n-body-tb.sv` are SystemVerilog files with implementations of a 2x2 systolic array 
for n-body simulations in one dimension. The remaining files in this directory are auto-generated by ModelSim. Opening this directory as
an existing project in ModelSim will automatically load the workspace and allow easy test benching.

### `2x2-systolic-n-body.sv`

`2x2-systolic-n-body.sv` contains the SystemVerilog code for a non-synthesizable 2x2 systolic array in one dimension. Scaling to higher
dimensions (or a larger width array) is easily achieved.

### `2x2-systolic-n-body-tb.sv`

`2x2-systolic-n-body-tb.sv` contains test bench code for simulating the non-synthesizable `2x2-systolic-n-body.sv` code in any FPGA
test bench software. We used Intel's ModelSim. Each individual module in `2x2-systolic-n-body-tb.sv` tests either a specific design from
`2x2-systolic-n-body.sv` or multiple designs simultaneously, for instance the module `acceleration_time_tb` simulates a 4-body system while
`cell_tb` only simulates a single cell.
